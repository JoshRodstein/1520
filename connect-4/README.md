    - Enter Valid Name and Birth day for both players and press enter


#### Issues

The only issue i have is with my date object creation.
    - I validate the input with regex and move the three values into sperate indeces within an array
    - Date object creates wrong date
    
**Work Around**
    - Currently Player 1 goes first always
    - All other requirements have been implemented and game runs as expected.
